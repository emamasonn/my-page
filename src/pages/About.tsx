              Hi, I'm Emanuel Mason and I want you to get to know me a little
              bit better and tell you about how I ended up working as a
              developer.

              When I moved to La Plata to study Computer Engineering I had to
              look for a job, that led me to work as a dishwasher, kitchen
              helper or as a builder.
              <br />
              But that had nothing to do with programming and that bothered me.
              I have some friends who at that time worked as developers, that
              motivated me to start studying on my own and after a few hard
              months I was able to get my first job as a developer and from then
              on I did not stop growing professionally.
            </Text>
            <Text mb="20px">
              Since then I had several jobs as a developer and I can say that in
              each one I learned a lot and I was lucky that I always had a great
              team.
            </Text>
            <Text mb="20px">
              I worked in different types of companies such as a start up, a
              large company and as a freelance so I had in my hands varied
              projects from creating an application from scratch to work on a
              finished product.
            </Text>
            <Text mb="20px">
              Not everything is development, I also love other things like
              outdoor activities such as trekking or just having some mates in a
              park, BJJ and making a barbecue with family or friends.
